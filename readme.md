# Implementation

The Kalyna cipher is implemented in python3. It can be run as python module package. But the code can be tested file by file.

# File structure

- root
  - \_\_init__.py
  - cipher.py
  - key_expansion.py
- tools.py
- readme.md

# Test the code
- Code can be tested file by file
- For getting only round key generation, test the file named key_expansion.py
- For testing the encryption and decryption, test the file named cipher.py
- Some of the code for analysis can be found on analysis branch
