# Implementation

The Kalyna cipher is implemented in python3. It can be run as python module package. But the code can be tested file by file.

# File structure

- root
  - \_\_init__.py
  - cipher.py
  - key_expansion.py
- tools.py
- readme.md

# Test the code
- Code can be tested file by file
- For getting only round key generation, test the file named key_expansion.py
- For testing the encryption and decryption, test the file named cipher.py
- Kalyna\_attack\_tested folder contains the integral attack tested files, please run cipher.py
- DDT.py and LAT.py is used for generating DDT and LAT for the cipher
- Crypto\_term\_paper is the term paper
- Crypto\_presentation is the presentation
- Presentation file can be found on below link
