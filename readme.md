# Implementation

The Kalyna cipher is implemented in python3. It can be run as python module package. But the code can be tested file by file.

# File structure

- Kalyna
  - kalyna
    - cipher.py
    - \_\_init.py
    - key_expansion.py
  - kalyna_attack_tested
    - cipher.py
    - \_\_init.py
    - key_expansion.py
  - Crypto_presentation.pdf
  - Crypto_term_paper.pdf
  - DDT.py
  - LAT.pt
  - readme.md
  - tools.py

# Test the code
- Code can be tested file by file
- For getting only round key generation, test the file named key_expansion.py
- For testing the encryption and decryption, test the file named cipher.py
- Kalyna\_attack\_tested folder contains the integral attack tested files, please run cipher.py
- DDT.py and LAT.py is used for generating DDT and LAT for the cipher
- Crypto\_term\_paper is the term paper
- Crypto\_presentation is the presentation
- Presentation file can be found on below link
